## Who am I?

Well... It's quite difficult to describe myself...

* just a simple and humble person who's mostly living behind his computer.
* pretty discreet but you might have seen me under few screen names like __Jiab77__ or __Doctor Who__.

## What am I doing?

I'm interested by many domains but I'm mostly using my time for programming, doing security research and ethical hacking.

## Where to find my work?

I'm hosting my projects in several places but the most interesting ones are on [GitHub](@Jiab77).
