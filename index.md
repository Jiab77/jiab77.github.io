## Who am I?

Well... It's quite difficult to describe myself...

* just a simple and humble person who's mostly living behind his computer.
* pretty discreet but you might have seen me under few screen names like __Jiab77__ or __Doctor Who__.

## What am I doing?

I'm interested by many domains but I'm mostly using my time for programming, doing security research and ethical hacking.

### Am I doing non-ethical hacking?

Yes, sometimes but mostly under another screen name.

## Where to find my work?

I'm hosting my projects on several places but the most interesting ones are on [GitHub](https://github.com/Jiab77).

## Where to find me?

As you might imagine, I'm not someone very sociable and you'll never find me talking about my private life in public but here are places where I like to be:
